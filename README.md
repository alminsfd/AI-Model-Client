A responsive, secure web application to manage an inventory of AI models. Users can add, view, edit, search, filter, and delete AI model entries.

Built with **React** (React Router) on the client and a self-hosted backend for CRUD operations and protected routes. The UI is designed to look modern and professional and to work well on mobile and desktop.
